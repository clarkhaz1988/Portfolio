## About

Hi, My name is Chaz. I have an analytical background in manufacturing. For the last 3 years I've found great pride in disecting complex data and identifying patterns and trends to lower costs and improve efficiency.

This is a repository to showcase my skills through various projects. This repository will be updated periodically as I gain new skills.
